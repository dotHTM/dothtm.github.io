I didn't know what I was using **blogging** for.

I didn't know what I was using **social media** for.

I didn't know what I was using **group chat** for.

I clashed with someone I thought was really cool, but they used argumentative style that reminded me of an oppressor class.

So I mostly tried to *delete my presence* in the above spaces.

I was too fragmented by trying to have multiple writing destinations, and I was unsuccessfully chasing the network that I loved from an old, arguably dead platform.

A diversity of perspectives and of my college era social media evolved into a narrow focused echo chamber of voices begging for essentially the same support and not having their needs met, including my own.

That, or I never felt catharsis from writing online anymore because it was just going into the vacuum.

`---`

Regardless, I don't like participating in a platform or brand war. Especially when the arguments against a thing I participate in are flaws in the dissenting party's preferred alternative.


I can both like the output of (an artist, a creator, a company, a brand, a party) and still want for improvement of that source. "Do better" is not always a call for boycott or extradition.

I don't want to participate in cycles of guilt through association. And I need to own the idea that if someone is too upset by me including a "problematic" voice, they should also own decisions about cutting me out of their space.

I should strive to improve, but I can't average out my feelings for the simple fear of loss. Then I'm not making anyone's life better, particularly my own.

"I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him." has a lot of overlap with "Let [they] who has no sin cast the first stone."
