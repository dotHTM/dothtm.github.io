# User Agreements and Software Licensing

Everyone's favorite subject: EULAs and the TOS, GPLv3 vs everthing else, "Do you 'own' what you hold physically in your hand?"

## This is hardly new

While other games on all digital-shop connected platforms have offered similar "buy in the physical store, download off the digital store" product, Licensing of games, especially when they came off carts and moved to PC standard equipment have included legal language saying what you're allowed to do with it, how they're not liable, and how you're allowed to seek solutions to disputes (i.e. binding arbitration).

While a lot of the opinion being written frames the Nintendo TOS changes as being specifically interpreted as "you may not emulate or pirate with our products" neither of those use cases appear to be much of a concern to this TOS change.

I believe this change is likely intended to establish a base line of liability protection that Nintendo is warning you that if you use your device in an unauthorized way, it is not their fault if/when that results in your device not working anymore. They sold you a thing, engineered to work with a system of other components and other customers, and they have the right to protect their infrastructure, their brand, their customer satisfaction, and they don't owe you the right to cheat, pirate, or otherwise use the product in a way other than the way it was intentionally designed and advertised.

Look at how the PS3 got sony in a class action lawsuit in the US over the removal of the Linux OS feature that they partially blamed on enabling piracy, but so late in the console's life, that I think the real reason was basic cost cutting. Elimintating features is the easiest way to reduce support and maintenance costs. If the PS3 OS team was running into added costs at the need to retain the linux OS option (which arguably never ran well enough to be interesting beyond a few data cluster applications), then cutting expenses to provide security both to the business and to the product safety was the right choice.

They announced the change, they warned users of the limitation, and those who wished to retain the feature were given the ability to take their system out of the update cycle to keep it, at the cost of feature parity with updated systems. And yet, the class action proceeded and settled. 

I'm sure the customers who used it for data cluster equipment made their choice without concern, and then replaced that hardware with other options to little overall concern.



## Switch 2 sales options

Switch 1 release
- physical card, may have patches to download for online compatibility or content
  - limited by engineering of the switch 1's card system and device compatitbility
    - what would be required to increase the capacity of the sw1 card system?
      - would that have broken compatibility with systems?
        - the OLED being mistaken for a "Switch Pro" distinction
        - the lite having limitations around docks and AV output over USB-C to cut costs
        - a "new Switch" feature separation that would be akin to the like-named DS family?
          - isnt that clear with the "Switch 2" naming?
- digital download
  - simple, going to exist anyway
  - sales numbers not limited by physical production
  - little restrictions to publisher
  - increased requirements on some end users
    - "download in rural areas"
    - internal storage limitations and need to buy and re-download software when upgrading existing previous upgrade.
- card in a box
  - you buy it in a store, so retail _might_ have a sale different than the Nintendo digital store
  - you get a box with art (that's basically empty)
  - you have to download it like a digital purchase from the Nintendo digital store
  - non-transferable license, it's attached to your online account and has all the usage limitations of a digital purchase

Switch 2 release differences
- physical card
  - full game on card
    - new speed
    - new sizes
    - more sizes on the way
    - pricey because new production line
  - game key card
    - the requirements of a digital purchase
    - the transferability of ownership or posession like a physical purchase
- Digital Download Upgrades from Sw1 to Sw2
  - some paid, some free
  - paired with a physical "full game" card on Sw1, carries most of the transferability of ownership as a physical release, without the storage access advantages
    - If the upgrade replaces assets such that it is a substantial fraction or replacement of the original content, then the original game card functions in similar style to a "game key card" minus paid upgrade license being transferable too

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MCkeLReeHc> maybe there's something mentioned in here about the eventual cost drop after production ramps up?



## 3rd party devs, business decisions, and economies of scale

Breakdown of the launch 3rd party titles, and the apparent "trend" that purchases of content in boxes will be "Game Key Cards".

> Note: Split Fiction further is not a "game key card" but a "code on a card" which means that this becomes associated with your online account, and cannot be resold.



# Countering Misinformation in the specs


A Fairly good argument that the prodcut will be good quality to those who want it. Skeptisism at extrodinary claims without proof of the shipped product. Consideration that technology always steps forward and the realism that once a product ships, something else will come after it.
