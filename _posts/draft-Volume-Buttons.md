Inconsistent UI across devices and mental load.

# Electronics

- Mostly consistant:
  - left is quieter, right is louder.
  - game systems
    - pair:
      - Nintendo Switch
      - Valve Steam Deck
      position: on top, to the left.
      extra: headphone jack in similar location on right
      discrepency: Steam Deck's Power button on right side

- Apple
  - item: iPad
    
    On the right side of the screen when in portrait orientation (wired port on bottom).
    
    Landscape orientation defined by covers, "book" or laptop style makes the right portrait edge external, away from the spine. This is consistent with many cases and keyboard accessories.
    
    Above Landscape orientation places volume buttons on top, to the left.
    
    Depending on hardware model and software version, could be static or dynamic based on orientation.
    
    In static mode, pressing right is quieter and left is louder. regardless of orientation, the same hardware button results in the same action.
    
    When in dynamic mode, there are two orientation modes: (I) Landscape & upside down portrait, (II) Portrait & upside down landscape.
    
    In mode (I) Landscape & upside down: pressing right is louder and left is quieter. In mode (II) Portrait & reversed landscape, the reverse.
    
    Since the two primary orientations switch between these two modes, A matter of a few degrees can change the behavior of these buttons, and may not be reliable when operated blindly.
    
    If the buttons had been placed on the upper edge of the standard Portrait mode, the mode switch would only occur in the two reversed orientations, and might not have been created as a dymanic feature at all.
    
  - item: iPhone
  
    On the left side of the screen when in portrait orientation (wired port on bottom).
    
    Default Landscape orientation defined by placing the device in rotation lock and opening an app or content that forces the landscape orientation. This can be accomplished via apps like YouTube and launching a video into "full screen" or any games that require the landscape orientation. This also places the camera lenses at the top of the device on the back.
    
    Landscape orientation places volume buttons on bottom, to the left. 
    
    This makes using the volume buttons as camera shutter trigger difficult. Perhaps this explains the invention of the new capacitive dedicated camera side button, now oriented in the old volume buttons' location when the camera lens is oriented upward.
    
    

# Vehicles - Steering Wheels

- Subaru Outback 2019
  - Media cluster on left, opposite head unit in center.
    - Left is previous track (immediate change)
    - Right is next track (immediate change)
    - Up is Louder
    - Down is Quiet
  Track changes are immediate, and follow the same logic as a typical CD player (usually two presses of left to first move the playhead to the begining of the current track, then quickly again to the previous track).

- Mini Cooper 2023(?)
  - Media cluster on right. (Would be exterior side on a UK vehicle)
    - Left is Quiet
    - Right is Louder
    - Up is previous track (requires center "enter" press to change)
    - Down is next track (requires center "enter" press to change)
  Track changes are done via a HUD menu that lists the available tracks, and center button selects the track to play, so the driver can skip to a specific song without needing to start each within the sequence.

  Media cluster and cruise control settings are on opposite sides compred to the Outback, which may make more sense if the media controls are considered most useful "away" from the center head unit, to duplicate buttons in as many convienent places for the driver to avoid being distracted. Therefore, the Mini's placement would be most useful to a UK driver where the wheel is on the opposite side of the car, and parhaps that's one part they refuse to mirror for left-hand-drive markets.
  
- Toyota rental SUV 2023(?)
  - Media cluster on left(?)
    - Left is Quiet
    - Right is Louder
    - Up is next track (immediate change)
    - Down is previous track (immediate change)
  
  The media cluster location matches the Outback, a model produced by a Japanese company for a US market, however the oriention is a mish-mash of ideas. I needed to think of the volume as being something like a switch or steam deck, but the track control was like "driving into the next song" or "going backwards to the last song".
